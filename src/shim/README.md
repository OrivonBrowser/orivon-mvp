# `src/shim/` — `orivon-node-shim`

**What lives here.** Node's `net`, `dgram` and `fs` APIs, reconstructed on top of `orivon.*`,
so that ordinary Node libraries run unmodified inside a renderer. Load-bearing, not a developer
nicety: without it the flagship cannot be a URL-delivered app
([`ADR-0005`](../../docs/decisions/ADR-0005-apps-are-url-addressed-not-bundled.md)).

**What it depends on.** [`src/contracts/`](../contracts/).

**What it must never import.** `electron`, or [`src/broker/`](../broker/). The shim runs in the
renderer and reaches the broker only through `orivon.*`. Importing the broker would hand it
main-process authority it must not have.

**Owner stream.** `shim` — build step 3. Also owns the `renderer.resolve.alias` map in
`electron.vite.config.ts`; no other stream writes there.

**Five binding requirements** from [`handle-contracts.md`](../../docs/architecture/handle-contracts.md)
§What the shim must do. Read them before writing a line here — each cost real time to discover:

1. **Completeness is measured against a dependency's real call graph, never this repo's
   anticipated surface.** `bittorrent-dht` calls `net.isIP()` before every send. It is not a
   socket operation and is easy to omit; its absence made the DHT bind successfully and then
   send nothing, forever, with no error.
2. **A polyfilled timing primitive must make errors louder, not quieter.** A
   `queueMicrotask`-based `process.nextTick` swallows exceptions that real Node surfaces to the
   process.
3. **Every reply-carrying message over a `MessagePortMain` needs an explicit timeout.** This
   transport fails by silence.
4. **No transferables on the renderer -> main path, ever.** `electron#34905`: the message
   silently never arrives.
5. **Synchronous Node accessors are served from values captured at acquisition**, never from a
   cache an event fills in later.
