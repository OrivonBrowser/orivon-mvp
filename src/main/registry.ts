// The composition root's mechanism.
//
// Each subsystem -- broker, shim, loader, trust indicator, Nostr, telemetry --
// registers itself in src/main/subsystems.ts rather than editing app lifecycle
// code, so adding one is an APPEND (two lines: an import and a list entry) and
// never an edit to shared logic. Git merges appends at different positions of
// a list cleanly; it does not merge two edits to the same conditional.
//
// Without this, src/main/index.ts is the file every future stream must edit to
// wire itself in, which makes it the repository's worst merge surface at
// exactly the moment several streams are running at once. See
// docs/development/parallel-work.md.
//
// TWO PHASES, because Electron forces it: protocol.registerSchemesAsPrivileged
// must be called BEFORE the app is ready, and build step 5's range-capable
// custom media scheme needs it (build-plan.md SS5). A single phase would make
// that stream restructure index.ts -- exactly what this exists to prevent.
//
// This module imports nothing from electron at runtime: `App` is a type-only
// import, erased by verbatimModuleSyntax. That erasure is what makes the two
// functions below unit testable without launching Electron.
