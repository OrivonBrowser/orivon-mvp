# `src/broker/` — the capability broker

**What lives here.** Manifest parsing, the grant model, per-origin enforcement, grant prompts,
per-app `session` partitions, and the handle tables. **This is the product** — everything else
in the repository exists so that this can be reached from a web page
([`ADR-0002`](../../docs/decisions/ADR-0002-capability-api-is-the-durable-asset.md)).

**What it depends on.** [`src/contracts/`](../contracts/) and `electron`.

**What it must never import.** [`src/shim/`](../shim/), [`src/loader/`](../loader/), or any
renderer code. The broker is the authority; importing one of its consumers inverts the trust
direction and makes the boundary meaningless.

**Owner stream.** `broker` — build step 2, and the critical path.

**Settle the origin definition here.** It keys storage, session partitions, grants and derived
identity keys. Changing it after the first grant is persisted orphans every app's data
([`ADR-0003`](../../docs/decisions/ADR-0003-local-first-storage.md)).

**The three threats most likely to be got wrong** ([`security-model.md`](../../docs/architecture/security-model.md)):
T1/T10 path traversal, T3 origin spoofing via `senderFrame`, and **T12 DNS rebinding** — the
subtlest, because a correct glob matcher fed a *hostname* is still completely defeated by it.
Patterns are checked against **resolved addresses**, always.
